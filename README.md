# DS-Final-Project
Data Science final project, COSC 481 Spring 2019

### Team
- Sebastian Cortes
- Olivia Lyons
- Destiny Adams (Organizer)
- Hannah Roe
- Harrison Ratcliffe

## Purpose
This major project in data science is about two things: executing a full data science study,
similar to ones we have seen throughout the course; and determining where a data science
approach can be beneficial to a societal need or movement.

Needless to say, this second part is somewhat vague. What I am looking for is some
question that can be answered through the power of data that can help a community of
people better themselves. This can be as broad or as narrow as you’d like. I’d recommend
taking a look at the various studies posted by the Data Science for Social Good group at
[the University of Chicago](https://dssg.uchicago.edu/) for general ideas of what I’m
looking for. From there your team should look at the various data sets available to you at
the link posted on the course website and identify a broad category (i.e. weather, politics,
etc.) that you’d like to explore. You may also attempt a current competition available
through [Kaggle’s Data Science for Good](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions). NOTE:
there are a lot of Kaggle competitions, only the Data Science for Good ones are
automatically eligible.

### Proposal
Your team will need to narrow down a central question you plan on
exploring very early on in the process. Once you have established your question, you
should prepare a one-page paper detailing your question and its relevance to a societal
need. You should also include what data set you’ll be using and any citations you need to
make your team’s case. Note: citations are not necessary, but your team’s argument for
societal need may be rejected due to lack of evidence and your team will have to redo the
paper (with a grade penalty).

### Data
Once your team’s question has been approved, you should start to clean up your
data and do your data analysis. There is no specific turnin for this (other than notification
of the data set selected via email) but you should include information about how you
formatted your data and your data analysis in the final paper (see below). Once you have
clean data, you should create whatever models you need to answer the question you have
chosen in Python, using whatever third-party modules you need. There is no restriction
beyond the language for your programs.

### Paper
In addition to your team’s code, there will be a final paper documenting
your team’s process. The first page of this is your justification paper, but the remaining
parts of the paper should include information about: how your approach or the question is
unique; what data and conclusions are already available; how the data has been altered
(cleaned); what inferences you were able to make during the data analysis portion of the
project; what successes and failures you had during the model creation process; what
conclusions you are able to make in reference to your question; and what future work is
available in further exploration of your question. Including appropriate diagrams of
appropriate size (but not including any significant amount of code, or the required
bibliography, title, and abstract), this should be at least 10 pages, single-spaced with 1”
margins, 12pt Times New Roman font, no excessive spacing, and you should have at
least 10 in-line cited sources. You may use MLA, Chicago, or AMS citation styles.

### Presentation
During the final class you and your team will be giving a professional, 20 minute
presentation on your question, methodology, and results. Your presentation must include
the following components:
* Your team’s question and the motivation for answering said question
* Establishing what results are already available
* Your team’s methodology, including justification for the methodology
* Your results delivered in a clear, concise manner
* What the next steps in this project would be

Presentations will be evaluated by the instructor and the class. You will be evaluated on
clarity, content, ability to answer questions, presentation ability (this includes being able
to deliver a clean, well-rehearsed lecture, with appropriate body language, and no
technical hiccups), and professional appearance (both attire and slides). After the
presentation, there will be a 5-minute Q&A session.
